# This is a GitLab CI configuration to build the project as a docker image
# The file is generic enough to be dropped in a project containing a working Dockerfile

# do not use "latest" here, if you want this to work in the future
image: docker:19

stages:
  - build
  - push

variables:

before_script:
  # docker login asks for the password to be passed through stdin for security
  # we use $CI_JOB_TOKEN here which is a special token provided by GitLab
  #- echo -n $CI_JOB_TOKEN | docker login -u gitlab-ci-token --password-stdin $CI_REGISTRY
  - docker info

Build:
  stage: build
  script:
    docker build -t esek/ekorre .

# # Here, the goal is to tag the "master" branch as "latest"
Push latest:
  variables:
    # We are just playing with Docker here. 
    # We do not need GitLab to clone the source code.
    GIT_STRATEGY: none
  stage: push
  only:
    # Only "master" should be tagged "latest"
    - master
  script:
    # Because we have no guarantee that this job will be picked up by the same runner 
    # that built the image in the previous step, we pull it again locally
    - docker pull $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_SHA
    # Then we tag it "latest"
    - docker tag $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_SHA $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:latest
    # Annnd we push it.
    - docker push $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:latest

# Finally, the goal here is to Docker tag any Git tag
# GitLab will start a new pipeline everytime a Git tag is created, which is pretty awesome
Push tag:
  variables:
    # Again, we do not need the source code here. Just playing with Docker.
    GIT_STRATEGY: none
  stage: push
  only:
    # We want this job to be run on tags only.
    - tags
  script:
    - docker pull $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_SHA
    - docker tag $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_SHA $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME
    - docker push $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME
